<Overview>

Untitled Bank is a permissionless, and modular lending platform designed to provide a seamless and inclusive experience for all users. Our mission is to unlock the potential of underutilized assets by leveraging our unique Aggregated and Layered Bank architecture. Untitled Bank simplifies asset management and lending operations, making decentralized finance (DeFi) more accessible to both novice and experienced users.

<Problem Statement>

Decentralized finance (DeFi) has transformed traditional financial systems by removing intermediaries and relying on smart contracts for trustless transactions. While DeFi offers numerous advantages over traditional finance, including transparency and accessibility, existing lending platforms often face limitations. which we identified as such:

Limited asset diversity and accessibility on existing platforms, creating barriers for regular retail users.

Low capital efficiency due to underutilized assets in a fragmented ecosystem.

Lack of cross-chain interoperability, restricting liquidity and access to assets across different chains.

DAO-centric risk management potentially limiting scalability and efficient decision-making.

Untitled Bank aims to address these issues with a interoperable modular architecture that leverages a Layered Bank system to offer a more inclusive and flexible approach to decentralized lending.

<Solution: Aggregated Lending>

Aggregated Layers: Core Bank and Core Market
Untitled Bank introduces Aggregated Lending, an innovative solution that unifies permissionless lending markets through aggregation layers - the Core Market and Core Bank. The Core Market aggregates markets with identical collateral-loan asset pairs, while the Core Bank manages the aggregated liquidity pools. This layered structure preserves the flexibility of modular market creation while solving liquidity fragmentation, offering users the best of both modular and monolithic lending systems.

Layered Bank Structure
The cornerstone of Untitled Bank's design is its Layered Bank structure, which offers unparalleled flexibility and accessibility in asset management.

A major challenge with modular lending platforms is their complex earning process compared to monolithic platforms like Aave or Compound. On these platforms, users simply deposit assets into a single pool. However, in modular systems, users must navigate different Bank Operators, assess the risk level of each vault, and ensure they are entrusting their funds to reliable operators.

At Untitled Bank, we eliminate this complexity by introducing the Core Bank, where a DAO manages asset distribution across multiple Custom Banks‚Äîoffering the simplicity of monolithic platforms with the flexibility of modular lending.


Depositing experience for different user types
Core Bank
Designed for users seeking simplicity, the Core Bank functions as a vault where users can easily deposit and lend assets without complex configurations.

Asset Distribution: Funds from the Core Bank are distributed to various Custom Banks based on DAO voting, ensuring optimized and secure asset allocation.

Custom Bank
Built for advanced users and institutions, Custom Banks provide flexibility with configurable risk levels, managed independently by different Bank Operators.

Benefits
User-Friendly: Simplifies the experience for users of all expertise levels.

Capital Efficiency: Improves asset utilization by effectively pooling and distributing funds.

DAO Governance: Encourages long-term commitment through DAO voting on asset distribution within the Core Bank.

Untitled Bank offers the best of both worlds, providing ease of use similar to Aave or Compound while harnessing the flexibility and customization of modular lending.

Broad Asset Support
Untitled Bank offers a diverse range of assets, surpassing traditional lending platforms by supporting both key DeFi assets and long-tail assets. 

Key DeFi assets include popular tokens backed by leading protocols, while long-tail assets are carefully selected based on manageable volatility, sufficient liquidity to minimize slippage, proven market maturity, and rigorous security audits to ensure safety.

Benefits:

More options for diversification and risk management.

Boosts platform liquidity and market depth.

Supports broader participation across different asset types.

Layered Market Structure
Untitled Bank's Layered Market Structure revolutionizes modular lending by solving the critical challenge of liquidity fragmentation. In traditional modular lending protocols, the coexistence of multiple markets with identical collateral-loan pairs leads to scattered liquidity and market inefficiencies. Our innovative approach combines the flexibility of modular lending with the efficiency of monolithic systems through our Core Market feature.

Core Market Solution 
Our Core Market feature aggregates markets with identical collateral-loan asset pairs, creating a unified lending experience:


Collateralizing and Borrowing experience for different user types
Smart Market Whitelisting: Through DAO governance, markets are carefully vetted and whitelisted to join the Core Market ecosystem.

Optimal Order Distribution: The platform intelligently routes borrow orders across whitelisted markets, maximizing efficiency and stabilizing rates.

Unified Liquidity: Users access a single, aggregated liquidity pool for each asset pair, simplifying the lending experience while maintaining the benefits of modular design.

Key Advantages 
The Layered Market Structure delivers significant benefits to all participants:

Seamless User Experience: Access to aggregated liquidity through a single interface eliminates the complexity of comparing multiple markets.

Maximum Capital Efficiency: Unified liquidity pools ensure optimal utilization rates and stable interest rates across the platform.

Community-Driven Growth: DAO governance of market whitelisting promotes quality control and active community participation in platform development.

Through this innovative architecture, Untitled Bank creates a lending platform that combines the customization of modular design with the efficiency of unified liquidity pools, setting a new standard for DeFi lending.

Risks for Lending Users
This section outlines the primary risks associated with Untitled Bank. By using this protocol, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and accepted all risks outlined in this documentation.

Smart contract risk
Smart contract risk is inherent when using DeFi protocols. While smart contracts‚Äîself-executing code running on blockchains‚Äîare designed to be secure, they may contain vulnerabilities or bugs.

A flaw in smart contract code could allow attackers to exploit the protocol and steal funds, potentially resulting in losses for suppliers and borrowers. Given this significant risk in DeFi, users should thoroughly evaluate protocol security before participation.

Liquidation
When a borrowed amount exceeds the borrowing limit, the protocol allows liquidation‚Äîwhere a portion of the collateral is exchanged at market price with a liquidation discount. This mechanism incentivizes arbitrageurs to act quickly, reducing both borrower and protocol risk. The close factor (ranging from 0 to 1, typically 25%) determines how much of the borrowed asset can be repaid. Liquidations continue until the borrower's debt returns below their borrowing capacity. The liquidation incentive for our platform is min(50%, 1 - (1.4-0.4*LLTV) ).

Market risk of the protocol
Borrowing from Untitled Bank's market requires "excess collateralization"‚Äîsupplying collateral worth more than the borrowed amount. If collateral value falls below the borrowed amount before liquidators can act, borrowers lose the incentive to repay their position.

100% Utilization Risk
When an asset reaches 100% utilization (all supplied tokens are lent out), the pool becomes depleted. This prevents both withdrawals and new borrowing until the utilization rate decreases through loan repayments or new deposits. This risk particularly impacts users with large pool deposits or during periods of high borrowing demand.
